#First I declared the variables via input statements
#An example data set would be 2, 2, 2 for k, m, and n, respectivly
#For this data set, the result would be 0.78333

k = float(input("What is k?"))
m = float(input("What is m?"))
n = float(input("What is n?"))
x = k + m + n

#The I wrote variables that determined how likely an organism would be chosen first out of the population

kc = k / x
mc = m / x
nc = n / x

#Here is the list of probabilities for the second to be chosen after one organism has already been selected from the population

kcTwo = k / (x - 1)
mcTwo = m / (x - 1)
ncTwo = n / (x - 1)

#Now for the probability for the second organism to be chosen if it comes from the same group

kkcTwo = (k - 1) / (x - 1)
mmcTwo = (m - 1) / (x - 1)
nncTwo = (n - 1) / (x - 1)

#Below I put the probability of each cross having an offspring with at least one dominant allele

kxk = 1
kxm = 1
kxn = 1
mxm = .75
mxn = .5
nxn = 0

#Next I wrote a function that accounts for both the probability of an two organisms being chosen from a group and the probablity they will pass on at least one dominant allele
#All of the cross possibilities that are not two organisms from the same group are multiplied by two due to there being two different combinations of each possible

kxkp = kc * kkcTwo * kxk
kxmp = kc * mcTwo * kxm * 2
kxnp = kc * ncTwo * kxn * 2
mxmp = mc * mmcTwo * mxm
mxnp = mc * ncTwo * mxn * 2
nxnp = nc * nncTwo * nxn #I only added this portion so that if I come across a similar problem, I can make some minor adjustments to the code and have the variable ready to be called on (currently the equation equals 0 because there are no dominant alleles in the cross)

#Using the function above yeilded the overall result (probability of an offspring from two randomly choosen organisms from the population having a dominant allele)

result = (kxkp + kxmp + kxnp + mxmp + mxnp)
print(result)
